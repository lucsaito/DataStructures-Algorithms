# DataStructures-Algorithms
A few data structures and algorithms implemented in c++
## Sorting Algorithms
1. [Insertion sort](Algorithms/insertionsort.cpp): Accepts `std::vector<int>` as parameter.
2. [Bubble sort](Algorithms/bubblesort.cpp): Accepts `std::vector<int>` as parameter.

## Miscellaneous Algorithms
1. [Correct brackets sequence](Algorithms/correctbracketssequence.cpp): It checks whether a given sequence of brackets is correct or not. ex: "{({})}" => correct.
